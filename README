XenGraphiteIT

The purpose of this python code is connect to a Cirix Xen Server and/or Pool 
and pull statistics. These statistics will be gathered and sent to a listening
server with Carbon and Graphite installed on it to create pretty graphs.

Statistics to be pulled:

- Storage Repository(s):
-- Total Size
-- Utilized Space

- Xen VMs:
-- Total count (running) on server/pool

- XenServer (Hosts):
-- CPU Used
-- Memory Total
-- Memory Utilization


... More information to come soon.
